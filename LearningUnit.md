# Learning Unit

A Learning Unit has learning goals.  
It can have a video explaining the content that is to be teached.  
It can have one or more scripts providing material necessary. (-> user generated?)  
It can have a quiz to enable users to test theirselves.  
It can have further reading to teach yourself beyond the boundary of the learning unit.  
It has a discussion page to ask questions. (-> separate page? talk page is rather for Wikiversity internal communication concerning page status than for questions of understanding)
