# Lesson

A lesson has a name.  
It has learning goals to specify what is its intention.  
It can have a video explaining the content.  
It has one or more learning units being more specific learning items.

## Module

We could easily write a LUA module that would generate the lesson page.  
The learning unit names would be passed in a table.  
Video and learning goals would be simply transcluded to minify LUA usage.
